# Seer
Seer gives market based estimates of the likelihood of any kind of events while allowing participants to earn money for their predictions


### Mission and Vision
Seer aims to provide market based estimation of the likelihood of any kind of event. We envision to help information seekers subsidize markets related to events they are interested in, creating a fun and entertaining positive sum game for market participants.


### Impact
Seer is more than just reliable forecasts: Seer can help facilitate informed decision-making in the presence of uncertainty that can be beneficials to various stakeholders (i.e. correspondents, decision makers) such as health emergencies/outbreaks or geopolitical predictions.  

Sustainable and scalable project through decentralization and community-based economy of scale.

Seer offer advantages such as data and insights that can help build forecasting models for future events through participation on our platform, scalability to a diverse range of topics, and incentives (i.e. rewards) to encourage more market participation.
### Business Model
#### How does it work?
- Our prediction market will be built on Gnosis conditional token platform that allows users to speculate with crypto by participating in markets based on current world events such as who may win a local election or will the gas price increase.
- We operate by allowing participants to take financial positions on what they believe is the most likely outcome in a certain event, thereby aggregating beliefs over an unknown future outcome and providing insights to build forecasting models.
- A participant’s chance of making profit is what motivates him/her to make an accurate prediction.
- We provide services to onboard information seekers (i.e. companies/organizations/parties that need help to inform decisions such as us providing forecast through our platform what their customers want to watch, listen to and buy).
- We use smart contracts to mediate bets between different participants and reality.eth and Kleros to determine the final outcome.
- What makes us unique in the market is we center on “liquidity.”
- We cover a wide variety of thoughts and opinions of hot topics from global affairs & economics to entertainment on a regular basis to attract different demographics and to maintain their interests & stays on the platform.
- Efficient markets aggregate information from every available source in order to ensure they provide the best predictions possible.
- Our market-wide forecasts can generally be more reliable and balanced than any single expert forecast, since we gather and weigh predictions from many participants.
- People's trust and appreciation of our prediction market will only grow as leaders from different sectors help the information to become more reliable and effective.
- As more individuals participate in the market, more data is collected, and their effectiveness increases.
